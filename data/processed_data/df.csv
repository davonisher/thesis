AskYourDatabase presents an innovative concept that could transform the way we interact with our databases. The integration of ChatGPT into database systems to enable 'conversational' interactions seems like a game-changer, especially for those who may find SQL or Python scripts intimidating or time-consuming. The simplicity and user-friendliness this platform offers could potentially make data analysis more accessible and efficient. I'm looking forward to exploring this tool more!

Questions:

1- What types of databases are supported by AskYourDatabase? Is it compatible with both SQL and NoSQL databases?

2- How complex can the questions or queries be when chatting with the data? Are there any limitations in terms of the complexity of data analysis tasks it can handle?

3- Does AskYourDatabase offer any capabilities for data visualization or integration with data visualization tools?",0.0,5.0,review-651763,,1.0,0.0

your 30+ employees or your marketing department thought ‚ÄúHey, this might be unexpected to the people heavily using the premium functions. They‚Äôll likely run out of their 500 credits fast!‚Äù

Was an amazing tool, turns out it was too good to be true.

Bardeen made the service subscription based out of nowhere without any prior in app notice.

They basically used everyone as beta testers while being ""free"" to collect feedback and tons of talk + positive feedback about them. That part wouldn't even be much of a problem.

The problem is they rug-pulled their many users by adding this out of nowhere. Basically not giving people the chance to find an alternative if they became dependent on Bardeen. Which forces them to subscribe.

Truly a baffling move for a business with an excellent reputation to stain their reputation and name like this. People would have likely subscribed anyway. You must greatly underestimate the advantage you threw away by doing this. It is worth a 100x times more than a few extra subs.

On top of that it constantly bugs out on various things that worked excellent.",5.0,4.8,review-627458,52.0,4.3,3.0

The same technology is used by BrandFort for detecting spam, profanity and hate. But, the big selling point of the software is to detect complains and negative sentiment in a very precise way. This is important if you are selling a product (or yourself) on your Social Media presence. Think about a comment like this one: ""Oh my god, your product is so overpriced!"" Normal content moderation, which is focused on detecting spam and profanity, will not hide such a comment. However, let's be honest, as a proud business owner, you do not want such a comment on your Facebook or Instagram page. BrandFort will detect such comments and hide it from your page. The smart thing, BrandFort will hide such a negative comment, but the commentator will not notice it. The commentator will see their comment on your Instagram page. But no one else will. Take your time responding to it and win the hater over. You can react to the negative comment in peace, but at the same time, you know it's not negatively impacting your brand reputation.

Integration of KPIs directly into product specifications has ensured that each new feature release is justified by existing metrics and its success is measured by the data changes that follow. My favorite feature dashboard, which has afforded our team the ability to have our metrics from Mixpanel, qualitative feedback from Typeform, and additional product specifications integrated into one clear space. This had become a crucially important component of my workflow as a designer and PM who is routinely needing to generate buy-in from other c-suite members to justify new initiatives. The dashboards aggregate everything into a digestible place that is easily presentable to other members of the team. I could continue to go on about the benefits that Cardinal has provided, but the best way to feel the impact is to experience, for yourself, how Cardinal takes your pre-existing product processes to the next level.

The text editor is fairly easy to use, and it doesn‚Äôt take long to get the hang of it.

Even better, the fact that you get a free trial and gain 10k free words is fantastic for experimenting.

From a marketing perspective, I was impressed by the marketing analytics dashboard. It is exceptionally detailed, and it allowed me to gain further insights into my campaigns so that I could see what I was doing wrong (and the things I got right). It‚Äôs easy to understand, and it made the whole process more manageable.

The platform is enabling millions of people worldwide to escape the labor trap and build their own businesses. Its mission is to make starting a solo business easier than working for someone else. Durable was founded in 2021 and is based in San Francisco, California.",3.0,Yes,12500000.0,8.0,"I have so many questions and concerns about this ""website builder."" However, before delving into them, I must caution against relying on this tool for any important purposes, especially if you are considering using it for business. The reason being that you will not have ownership of your website, as you are unable to copy or export the code. The CRM is a nice feature; however, my suggestion is that if you have to choose, it would be better to invest in your website, spend the money on branding, and design so that customers will remember and admire you and using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of your client information. This way, in the event that this company goes out of business, you will not lose your website as you will have ownership of the code.

The strangest aspect of this business model is the many roles that the owner is attempting to play. Durable is asking users to either buy insurance from them or disclose information about their current insurance policies. However, Durable has not provided any explanation as to why they need access to users' financial information, nor is there any evidence to support their legal authority to conduct insurance business. Additionally, Durable would like to be your money manager, but it is unclear why Durable is qualified to act as a money manager for your business, as they have not provided any credentials or meaningful information on their expertise in this area. It seems that Durable wants to have control over every aspect of your life, business, and finances, manage your money, and in return, you will have no ownership. The creator's approach to launching a business website is unusual, and I strongly advise against sharing any personal information or giving them money. Please review their terms of service, which specifically state that they will own your website and that they can change the terms of service at any time. Check Crunchbase to see that this company was formed in 2021 and is in the early stages of financing with an investment firm. Please do not be deceived into thinking that you will have any legal recourse if this is not what it appears to be or if the owners decide to pivot their business strategy and leave you with nothing.

Edit: I have one more thing to say. It is troubling that Durable focuses on attracting very tiny, startup companies. It's important to keep in mind that they will never truly own the site, despite the fact that some business owners, such as dog walkers, artists, and daycare center owners, may see it as a way to avoid the perceived hassle of establishing a website. They will always be reliant on Durable, and they will have to continue making payments to keep the site up and running or risk losing it altogether. If you're a small business owner seeking a risk-free option to quickly and easily build a website, Google Business is worth considering, but you *must* learn how to customize your website for SEO or search engines will never find you. Google Business is a free platform with drag-and-drop customization options. Additionally, if you ever decide to switch platforms, you can use the takeout feature to download your website and take it with you. You might need up to a week to build it, but isn't it worth it? Although it doesn't seem as magical as this product, you won't run the chance of losing your website. To begin, create a company profile and follow the guided setup process. You can use the available tools and templates to build a website that reflects your brand's identity and even add code for further customization, if desired. Although you may want to think about hiring an expert in the future, Google Business is a great way to build your online presence quickly and for no cost. Try it out.

Here is the prompt,

```
I want to open a all-natural bubble tea shop, targeting stressed-out working professionals.

Please help me create a hypothetical User Persona, with a defined user background.

Problem:

Pains:
And particularly facing these adverse outcomes.

Goal:
Your Persona aims to attain this transformation.

Benefit:
So they can enjoy these favorable results.

Trigger:
This incident compelled your Persona to seek a solution.

Barriers:

```

And the result

```
**User Persona: Stressed-Out Sarah**

**Background:**
Sarah is a 32-year-old working professional who lives in a bustling urban area. She works as a project manager in a fast-paced tech company, where long hours, tight deadlines, and constant pressure are the norms. Her job demands not only her physical presence but also her mental energy. Sarah is highly dedicated to her work, often sacrificing her personal time to ensure her projects succeed. This lifestyle has started taking a toll on her well-being.

**Problem:**
Sarah is grappling with chronic stress and burnout due to her demanding job. She often feels overwhelmed, drained, and mentally exhausted. The work-related stress has started affecting her sleep, mood, and overall quality of life. She is searching for healthy ways to manage her stress and find moments of relaxation in her busy schedule.

**Pains:**
1. **Physical Exhaustion:** Sarah experiences frequent headaches, muscle tension, and fatigue due to prolonged periods of stress.
2. **Poor Sleep:** Her stress levels make it difficult for her to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night.
3. **Lack of Relaxation:** She struggles to find moments of tranquility during her hectic workdays.
4. **Decreased Concentration:** The constant stress has led to difficulty in focusing on tasks and making decisions.
5. **Social Isolation:** Sarah's busy work life leaves her with limited time to socialize or engage in hobbies, resulting in feelings of isolation.

**Goal:**
Sarah aims to attain a healthier work-life balance and manage her stress more effectively. She wants to incorporate relaxation and self-care practices into her routine to improve her overall well-being. Her ultimate goal is to find a way to unwind during her workdays and regain her sense of calm.

**Benefit:**
By achieving her goals, Sarah will:
1. Experience reduced stress and burnout, leading to improved mental and physical health.
2. Enjoy better sleep quality, allowing her to wake up refreshed and energized.
3. Enhance her concentration and decision-making abilities, leading to increased productivity at work.
4. Create opportunities for social interaction and personal hobbies, reducing feelings of isolation.

**Trigger:**
Sarah's turning point came when she experienced a panic attack during a particularly stressful presentation at work. This incident made her realize the urgent need to address her stress levels and prioritize her well-being.

**Barriers:**
1. **Time Constraints:** Sarah's demanding job often leaves her with limited time to invest in self-care activities.
2. **Skepticism:** She may be skeptical about the effectiveness of new relaxation methods, given her busy lifestyle.
3. **Work Culture:** The prevailing culture at her workplace might not encourage taking breaks or focusing on well-being during work hours.
4. **Lack of Knowledge:** Sarah might not be aware of the various options available to manage stress and find relaxation in her daily routine.

Understanding the challenges and aspirations of Stressed-Out Sarah will help you tailor your all-natural bubble tea shop to meet her needs. Your shop could provide her with a soothing and rejuvenating environment where she can take short breaks, enjoy healthy bubble tea options, and find moments of tranquility amidst her busy workdays.

First off, congrats on the Product Hunt launch! That's a big step, and it's totally okay to be a mix of thrilled and nervous. Been there, felt that!

Now, about Gist AI. I'm vibing with the problem you're solving. Summarization tools can be a hit or miss, and you've nailed the issues most of us face. The ""Read More"" feature? Genius! It's like having a 'skip intro' button but for content. ü§Ø

The unlimited, unrestricted summaries are a big win, especially for those of us who devour content like it's our job (because sometimes, it is). And let's not forget the language barrier you're smashing with the 30+ language translations. üåç

Kshitiz, your excitement about summarizing long PDFs for free is contagious. I mean, who wouldn't want that? üìö

A couple of things to ponder:

How does Gist AI handle super technical or niche content?
Any plans for mobile support?
Your tool sounds like a game-changer, and I'm stoked to see how it evolves. Keep crushing it, and best of luck! üöÄ

I have tried with two versions of the same photo, one with its original background and one without it (transparent) and I received two different meaningful prompts accordingly. The pricing is a bit off, in my opinion: it makes the top tier the best option but that might discourage the occasional user because they might never be using 500 prompts while the entry tier at 20 cents per prompt seems a bit overpriced in comparison. The ""issue"" with AI images is that the generated photos are still far away from usable in a professional environment and several tries and fine-tuning are required before getting a decent result; this app certainly create good prompts and it has room for improvements but ultimately its value will increase in time when AI generated images will also get better. To me in order to keep that pricing model additional features need to be added. For example, if it generates the prompt, why not offering also the change to use it on site to generate the next photo? Or why not transforming it into an API that can be integrated with existing AI image generators? Just my idea, of course.

One thing I'd definitely consider adding though is suggesting aperture, focus and other tech camera settings, when user upload a real photo.

Fun to use if you enjoy trying to create engaging and human conversational flows. *nerd alert*

Two things I don't love: 1. Needs work for our mobile visitors. Looks zoomed out and far from optimal for a mobile visitor, a bad experience on this is worse than no experience at all, so a bit of a showstopper for me at the moment, for risk of providing a bad experience (no way of tracking or following this experience to check it's going smooth for mobile visitors, so a tiny risk to go live with if have lots of visitors on mobile)

Secondly, at the end of every flow on the freemium a ""share this Landbot"" button appears alongside a CTA to create their own. Obviously, I get it, it's a free product, do what you want. If I want to remove that, I can pay to do so. Just my personal opinion, and more feedback than a request, is that I think it's a bad time to ""Hijack"" MY visitors attention to market YOUR product at what is often for these forms, the critical moment, the end. They're at a decision crossroads. We've just exchanged information, i've taken them on this journey, and then BAM, you come and sweep them off their feet and they forget all the sweet nothings they and i whispered to each other.

My only point is, IF others have this gripe too, they might leave and not give the product a chance to become part of their paid stack, instead of upgrading straight away to remove this barrier to them. If this barrier didn't exist, (your branding is still on the page top right anyway), they may implement, become an active user, and give you plenty of time to convert them to a paid plan as you continue to execute and improve the product from now on out.

Vaping is best known for helping thousands.,,may,"Miami, Florida, United States",2014-06-30,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",1-10,,"‚ÄúVaping‚Äù is simply inhaling any kind of vapor‚Äìusually through an e-cigarette or vape pen. Vaping is best known for helping thousands reduce or break their nicotine habit. People who have traded traditional cigarettes for e-cigarettes report better health, easier breathing, deeper sleep, and better check-ups at the doctor. But that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to vaping‚Äôs potential. Vaping is an incredible delivery system for tapping into the mood-altering powers of virtually all of Mother Nature‚Äôs bounty: plants, roots, leaves, fruits, seeds, barks and more. Now you can choose your mood more effectively than ever. Energy. Relaxation. Mental focus. Sexual arousal. Confidence. Happiness. Peace. It‚Äôs all available through the magic of the Mood Vapor Pen. It‚Äôs important to understand‚Äìvaping isn‚Äôt smoking. There‚Äôs no flame and nothing is burned. Instead, the Mood Vapor Pen creates a fine vapor, like steam. And what isn‚Äôt inhaled dissipates immediately, with no after aroma. A Mood Vapor Pen electronically generates just enough heat‚Äìwithout overheating‚Äìto release the essential medicinal and psychoactive compounds you choose. Mood Vaping doesn‚Äôt alter the precious ingredients being inhaled. It just delivers them immediately to the brain for the maximum effect‚Ä¶with the minimum cost and effort. Vaping is actually healthier than pills or edible concoctions, because it goes straight to the brain and puts no strain on the digestive system. Plus, since vaping produces virtually no smoke, you inhale little or no tar, ash or other toxic elements. There‚Äôs no combustion, no burning, no danger. More and more people are appreciating the importance of natural health. Mood Vaping contributes to health by giving you easy access to natural herbs which have been used for healing throughout history, around the world. The MVP ingredients in their herbal blends are all lab-tested, non toxic, organic and 100% natural.",1.0,,650000.0,,,,,,,,

Re:tune definitely deserves a shout. I've recently been given inspiration on a few things and long story short, knew that I would need an easily trainable AI chatbot to achieve certain goals.

Lo and behold, Re:tune appears just at the right time! I tried a few other AI chatbot builders but 1) the limits sucked and 2) they weren't as easy to setup.

I had a fully trained and deployed, niche AI chatbot within 10 minutes using Re:tune. There was a hiccup with some AI delusions but Dhanajoy and the team fixed this in no time by adding the Restrictions feature - spot on!

Now my chatbots are literally on point and firing on all virtual cylinders. I'm VERY much looking forward to the lead capture feature (ideally with Webhooks) so I can grab interested customers details at the right time.

They've recently release Capture, which can ask for any type of data you want to gather from the customer. This is a game changer.

For me, this is a platform to watch. My requests:
1. Have a developed integration marketplace, i.e. send chats to Google Sheets (upcoming webhooks / Zapier integrations will help with this)
2. Notifications - Notify on app when a keyword/lead is entered and handover to human (handover on roadmap I believe) or even send email
3. More automation capabilities. E.g. Run scheduled crawls of Google Drive folder/URL and pick up pdfs/website URLs automatically so to keep knowledge updated automatically (this is on the roadmap)

DJ asked on their Discord, but I can definitely see Re:tune as a leader in this space in 5 years of staying on current course. The ability for any non-coding entrepreneur to put a wealth of knowledge on a website within minutes is truly awesome. Thank you for helping me (and countless others) reach the next stage of my evolution!",1.0,4.9,review-681184,19.0,5.0,5.0

>. For your privacy, we store all of the recordings locally on your Mac. Only you have access to them. Compression and Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is all done locally. Recording data is never sent off of your machine.

Although recording data might not be sent off the machine, usage of GPT-4 does imply you're sending sensitive data to OpenAI (and thus off the machine).

Presumably you're embedding user's screen and audio data locally, which means that potentially the embedding process and definitely the response generation process both send data to OpenAI, which is a privacy concern.

Onboarding is clear and fast and task completion is a breeze as well. UI is friendly, except for the FRAMES section on the left, when I create a post: personally I wasn't able to understand what their function is because their imagery seemed unrelated with my post and when I clicked on few of them they seemed to get selected but nothing happened. They must have a function, and I always have a super dummy approach when I try and review new apps so maybe you could try to improve the informational side of what does what. Just my 2 cents, of course.

Personally, I would also add a publish button to post making window/draft, maybe beside PREVIEW. Right now it seems to be only available from the 3 dots on the CONTENT page. It makes perfect sense, don't misunderstand me, but whenever one step can be saved I'd always go for that.

All the above don't affect my rating because it is expected to have terrain for improvement at launch, especially when it comes to UI and documentation.

The issue I have is with AI-powered imagery: that technology is still far away from being usable in apps like this, because the results are awful. Those of Stori AI are not even that bad, but still not viable for branding, in my opinion. Thing is that this is a common problem to all similar apps right now, so I don't feel like it is a flaw of this particular app. My suggestion to anybody offering this kind of tech in an automated way as a feature of their app is to always ""sell it"" as a beta feature while offering in-app editing tools for real imagery as the selling point, because AI-powered imagery doesn't meet customers' expectations yet.

About AI-powered text, to the contrary, there's really good prompting behind this app, and with a bit of manual editing here and there one can really save time and money. That makes it a worthy app with great potential, to me; one that I will use for some of my side projects, and whose evolution I'll certainly keep an eye on. üëÄ

Voice Messages: A real game-changer for when you‚Äôre on the move or too lazy to type. üó£Ô∏è It makes communication so much more personal and convenient.
Cons üëÄ
Limited to Text & Voice: While voice messages are great, sometimes they're not enough, especially when trying to describe something visual like a design or a project. üé®
Organization: Voice and text messages can get cluttered, especially in group chats. It's hard to refer back to important points or visualize certain topics. üìö
WhatsApp is fantastic for simple, fast communication. But in an increasingly visual world, we might need something extra to make our interactions even more meaningful and organized.

I was looking for a good transcription service for WhatsApp, and most I had tried were pretty disappointing until I came across Whisperbot. It converts spoken text into written text with exceptional accuracy. It opens up new possibilities for working with spoken content.
The first thing that struck me was how well Whisperbot could accurately convert spoken text. Even with complex sentences and different speaking styles, it managed to convey the meaning precisely. This has opened up new possibilities for me to work with spoken content, as I can now use the transcriptions for reference, notes or even for creating articles. It really is a great tool for anyone dealing with a significant amount of spoken text.
What makes Whisperbot even more appealing is its ease of use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and I was able to get up and running quickly without any technical difficulties. The process is simple: you just upload the audio file with the spoken text and the service takes care of the rest. Moreover, the processing time is also impressive. I never had to wait long to receive my transcriptions, which significantly sped up my workflow.
Another aspect I really appreciate about Whisperbot is the accuracy of the transcriptions. I have used other transcription services that often struggled to correctly identify words and sentence structures, resulting in errors and ambiguities. With Whisperbot, however, I consistently received accurate transcriptions, which meant I no longer had to worry about missing important information.
In summary, Whisperbot completely fulfilled my search for a good transcription service for WhatsApp. It surpasses all other services I tried in terms of accuracy, reliability and ease of use. If you are looking for an effective and efficient way to convert spoken text into written text, I highly recommend Whisperbot. It will undoubtedly exceed your expectations and open up new possibilities for working with spoken content.",1.0,5.0,review-638505,3.0,1.0,0.0

I have been working with Writers brew AI for several months now and I want to emphasize the significant increase in efficiency that this application has brought to my daily work routine. Professionally, I regularly have to write emails and texts that should meet a certain minimum quality.

In the past, I often experienced writer's block and would leave things untouched for days until I was in the right mood to write the texts. With Writers brew AI, I can now simply jot down the text as it comes to mind. Afterwards, Writers brew AI immediately provides me with a polished, refined, and perfectly formulated version of the text that is also grammatically correct.

Moreover, writing texts is now incredibly fun. In the past, I often squeezed the last bit of brain out of me with force, with a lot of coffee and a lot of time, to write a good text. Now I write anything, no matter how I feel, and Writersbrew perfects it.

I could achieve something similar with Chat-GPT, of course. Some texts might even improve further if I could use GPT 4, but I don't have access to the API for that. Therefore, I exclusively use Writers brew AI with GPT 3.5. Nevertheless, I only work with Writers brew AI because it is possible to improve the text immediately. Writers Brew also has the option to use it with GPT-4 if you have the API.

Whether I'm writing my text in Pages, an email program, or on any website, I simply highlight my draft and directly insert the improved text into the corresponding text field using just a few keyboard commands through Writers brew AI. There's no need to open additional windows, and it doesn't require any additional mental effort. Furthermore, I have already automatically internalized the corresponding keyboard commands, so everything works effortlessly and like magic.

I want to emphasize once again that I hardly need direct access to GPT 4 or Chat-GPT for writing texts anymore, as everything can be done with Writers brew AI. Only for particularly difficult texts or when I want to delve into a topic brainstorm-style, do I still directly rely on GPT 4.

Edit:
""On July 6, 2023 , we gave all API users who have a history of successful payments access to the GPT-4 API (8k)""

OpenAI made the GPT-4 API available to all paying API customers. I am looking forward to being able to use Writer's Brew with GPT-4 now!

My Old Review from May:

Meanwhile, there have been some updates.

Now the application can be set so that the output language is identical to the input language. So, there are no more restrictions when using the application in German. Since the application can also be used with applications outside the web browser, I no longer need Google Chrome extensions and can directly and especially quickly access Writersbrew with keyboard commands.

This makes the application perfectly integrated into my workflow. For example, I wrote this text in German within Apple Pages. Before I post the text here, I can translate it to English with a mouse click without having to leave Apple Pages.",0.0,5.0,review-613656,4.0,5.0,
